# üìâ Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave a service) based on their behavior and attributes. It applies **classification algorithms**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation techniques** to identify high-risk customers and provide actionable business insights.

> üìå This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world classification problems using end-to-end machine learning pipelines.

## üéØ Project Objective

To analyze customer behavior data and build models that predict if a customer is likely to churn.  
This is crucial for businesses (especially telecom, banking, and SaaS) to improve retention strategies.
